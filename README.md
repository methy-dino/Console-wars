# Console-wars (or C-wars for short)

## what is it?
It's a command line game, where you control  a group of soldiers in your terminal, not in real-time, but through 'scripting', using a custom-made language, which has no name (yet!).

## how do I play?
There isn't a stable release yet, you are free to compile this repository and play it. \
Once compiled, it will require 3 arguments, the first, the quantity of soldiers, thesecond, the red team's script, and the third is the blue team's script.
## guide?
there is no guide to programming soldiers yet, it will come soon though!
